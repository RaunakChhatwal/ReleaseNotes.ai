      "description": "It's quite common to have a NotFound page with a wildcard path like this\n```\n<Routes>\n\t...\n\t<Route path=\"*any\" view=NotFound>\n</Routes>\n```\nIn ssr mode, most servers do a first match win approach, so we should register server functions before view routes, or else a wildcard route would block all api requests.\n\nFix: https://discord.com/channels/1031524867910148188/1218508054442545185"
